                    <p>Happy Birthday, Baby!</p>
                    <p>From the very first moment we started talking, I knew there was something special about you. You brought a light into my life that I never knew I needed, and each day that passes, I feel it growing stronger. You are my everything my reason to smile, my reason to hope, and my reason to love.</p>
                    I want you to know, deep in your heart, that you are loved beyond words. Every beat of my heart is for you, and every breath I take, I wish you were right here beside me. You are the love I’ve been dreaming of, and nothing, not even the distance between us can change that.
                  </p>
                    <p> I know we haven’t met yet, but I already picture the day I get to hold you, look into your eyes, and finally tell you face to face how much you mean to me. You make me feel loved in a way I never thought was possible.
                   You are my greatest treasure, my forever baby hahaha. I can’t wait for the day we’ll make all of this real, but until then, I want you to always remember my love for you grows stronger with every passing second.</p>
                    <p> I love you even more when you’re feeling down or not in the mood. Those are the times when I wish I could be there to hug you and make everything better.
                        When life gets tough or you’re not feeling your best, please remember that I’m here for you. I may not be able to be there physically, but I want to be the person you turn to when you need someone to lean on. You don’t have to go through anything alone, Baby </p>
                    <p> I love you so muchh, Baby. Enjoy your day!! </p>
